# Valheim-project

Hello and welcome to my valheim project.

In this I will be going over simple project I worked on to spin up a valheim containter from scratch and how to get it working in kubernetes.

If you are attempting to do this yourself, you need to configure a kubernetes cluster yourself first AND a registry where the containters can sit.
